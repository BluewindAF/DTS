  <p id= "PH1"><b>History</b></p>
  <p id= "PB1">
    Super Smash Bros Melee was released in 2001 by Masahiro Sakurai <br>
    with the intent of it being a fighting, party game. However, people took
    it very seriously and started to host tournaments to gather other fellow smashers to play.

  <p id="PH2"><b>How Tournaments work</b></p>
  <p id="PB2">
    Tournament brackets come in different structures: Round Robin, Single Elimination, and Double Elimination.
    Generally, they are double elimination, best out of 3 until top 8 or so being best out of 5.

    Everyone is super supportive, encouraging, and friendly. Everyone on the grind to git gud.
    People bounce back when they take Ls and then win eventually. No toxic environment here.
    Everyone plays to play Melee. Come catch these hands.
